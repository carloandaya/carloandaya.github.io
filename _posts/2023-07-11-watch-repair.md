I found an old Kenneth Cole dress watch in a box and had the bright idea to replace its battery. I've had this watch for more than a decade and never had its battery replaced because it's a hassle bringing it to a watch shop and I didn't have the proper tools.

I bought a watch repair tool set and pried open the watch case to figure out what kind of battery it takes.
