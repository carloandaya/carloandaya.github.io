When setting up a new store, there are a few essential items that it needs: 

1. [Server Rack](https://amzn.to/431l12F) - The NavePoint server rack is mounted on the wall for optimal space usage. We use it to hold a switch and will add a [shelf](https://amzn.to/3OLvjOg) to hold the modem and other equipment if we don't mount them to the wall.

1. [PoE Switch](https://amzn.to/3SSEqy6) - Speaking of switches, the TP-Link 24 port PoE switch does a great job at providing a steady connection to our wired devices and provides power to VOIP phones.
