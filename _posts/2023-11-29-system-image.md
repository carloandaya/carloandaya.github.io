I was reminded once again of the fragile and fickle nature of electronic devices when my computer started rebooting a few minutes after logging in to Windows. Symptoms were intermittent: sometimes I would be able to log in and look around for a few minutes, other times it would reboot a few seconds after the login screen showed up. When I was able to check the event viewer, there were messages that seemed to indicate a driver issue.

My computer had acted this way before when I had a faulty graphics card. I would let the system cool off for a little bit and then it would be back to behaving normally. 

Started losing hope when I could not do a system restore

Somehow it was usable for a few

Decided to do a full system image

BIOS update was the solution
