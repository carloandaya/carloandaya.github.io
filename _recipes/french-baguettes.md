# Baguettes

## Ingredients
- 300g water at room temperature
- 10g fresh yeast or 4g active dry yeast
- 500g bread flour
- 4g sea salt

## Equipment
- Stand mixer
- Baking tray
- Parchment paper
- Dough knife
- Chef's knife
- Spray bottle

## Directions
- Pour the water into the mixing bowl.
- Add the yeast to the water and stir it in. Wait a few minutes for the yeast to activate if you are using dry yeast.
- Gradually add the bread flour and knead with the dough hook attachment until the dough forms into a ball.
- Add the sea salt to the mixture and knead some more until it is incorporated.
- Poke the dough to check that it is not wet and sticky then take it out of the bowl.
- Shape it into a ball then put it back in the mixing bowl.
- Cover the mixing bowl with cellophane and let the dough rise for 2 hours.
- When the dough has finished rising, run a spatula along its edge and shake it out of the mixing bowl onto a clean surface.
- Divide the dough into four parts with a dough knife.
### For each piece of dough
- With your hand in a C-shape (like an action figure), nudge the dough into a ball until its surface is smooth.
- Flatten the ball into a rectangle then fold it three times to make a log.
- Roll the log, applying pressure from the center to the ends to stretch it out.
- Put the dough on your baking tray lined with parchment paper.
- Let the dough rise for 45 minutes.
### Almost ready for the oven
- Start pre-heating your oven to 420 F.
- Make 3-5 diagonal slashes along each baguette with your chef's knife.
- Spray your baguettes with water. This will provide the steam and aid in creating a crust.
### Last few steps
- Load the baguettes into the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes or until they turn golden brown. 
- Remove the baguettes from the oven and cool them on a wire rack.
