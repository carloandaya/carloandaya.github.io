## Ingredients

Ingredient | Quantity | Notes
---|---|---
Water | 300 grams | Room temperature
Fresh yeast | 10 grams | Can substitute 4 grams of active dry yeast
Bread flour | 500 grams |
Sea salt | 4 grams |

## Equipment

* Stand mixer
* Baking tray
* Parchment paper
* Dough knife
* Chef's knife
* Spray bottle
* Wire rack

## Directions

1. Pour the water into the mixing bowl.
1. Add the yeast to the water and stir it in. Wait a few minutes for the yeast to activate if you are using dry yeast.
1. Gradually add the bread flour and knead with the dough hook attachment until the dough forms into a ball.
1. Add the sea salt to the mixture and knead some more until it is incorporated.
1. Poke the dough to check that it is not wet and sticky then take it out of the bowl.
1. Shape it into a ball then put it back in the mixing bowl.
1. Cover the mixing bowl with cellophane and let the dough rise for 2 hours.
1. When the dough has finished rising, run a spatula along its edge and shake it out of the mixing bowl onto a clean surface.
1. Divide the dough into four parts with a dough knife.

### For each piece of dough

1. With your hand in a C-shape (like an action figure), nudge the dough into a ball until its surface is smooth.
1. Flatten the ball into a rectangle then fold it three times to make a log.
1. Roll the log, applying pressure from the center to the ends to stretch it out.
1. Put the dough on your baking tray lined with parchment paper.
1. Let the dough rise for 45 minutes.

### Almost ready for the oven

1. Start pre-heating your oven to 420 F.
1. Make 3-5 diagonal slashes along each baguette with your chef's knife.
1. Spray your baguettes with water. This will provide the steam and aid in creating a crust.

### Last few steps

1. Load the baguettes into the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes or until they turn golden brown.
1. Remove the baguettes from the oven and cool them on a wire rack.
