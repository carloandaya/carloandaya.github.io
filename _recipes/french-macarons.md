Makes approximately 44 cookies good for 22 pairs.

## Equipment

* Stand mixer with whisk attachment
* Parchment paper
* Baking sheets
* Spatula
* Strainer
* Weighing scale
* Piping bag with round tip
* Macaron template
* Large mixing bowl

## Directions

1. Bring the egg whites up to room temperature by leaving them out in the stand mixer bowl for up to two hours.

1. Measure out the almond flour and powdered sugar into a mixing bowl. Sift the mixture.

1. Beat the egg whites with the granulated sugar to create a meringue, increasing the speed from low to high gradually. Stop when stiff peaks form.

1. Incorporate the almond flour and powdered sugar into the meringue in three parts with a spatula.

1. Add food coloring until you get the color you want.

1. Fold the mixture until you can write a figure 8 that disappears in a minute. Test after each fold. You are looking for the batter to have the consistency of honey without being runny.

1. Transfer batter to a pastry bag fitted with a plain round tip and pipe on parchment paper. You can place a template under the parchment paper to make the cookies consistent.

1. Drop the baking sheet on the counter to remove air bubbles.

1. Let stand at room temperature for one hour until the top is dry. This would be a good time to start making the filling.

1. Bake each tray at 300F for 14 minutes.[^1]

## Notes

[^1]: Use this as a starting point. If the bottom of the resulting cookie is still wet, increase the temperature; if it is dry, reduce the temperature. The cookie should leave some dirt on the parchment paper.
