I was ready to head out to go mountain biking. I had my helmet and gloves loaded in the back of the pickup truck and just needed to load the bike. 

I found the correct part number by referencing a [diagram of the brake system](https://parts.toyota.com/a/Toyota_2000_Tundra-Access-Cab-SR-5-47L-AT/63156168__6709498/BRAKE-TUBE--CLAMP/841420-4708.html).

## Parts

Part Name | Part Number | MSRP
---|---|---
[Tube, Front Brake, No. 4](https://parts.toyota.com/p/63156168/473140C011.html) | 473140C011 | $10.63
[Tube, Front Brake, No. 7](https://parts.toyota.com/p/63217573/473170c011.html) | 473170C011 | $10.57
