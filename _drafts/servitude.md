We live, we work, we die. Is that all that life is about? Would prefer not to live in service of anyone else. Or at least nothing so blatant. But I suppose that's what happens when we enter the working world. I can at least say that I can crawl out from under the financial commitments that I have made. And even those things can start to lose meaning the closer I get to death.

Media creates narratives that steer what society values. It's hard to get away from that influence even when I am aware of it happening. Being of service is something that is held in high regard. Be a man for others. Thank you for your service. But there is a line where it becomes servitude. And that's when the exchange of time and effort is no longer equitable.
